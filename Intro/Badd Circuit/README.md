## Solution

1. **Circuit Analysis**:  
   We begin by analyzing the provided logic circuit diagram to determine the relationships between inputs and outputs.

2. **Input Configuration**:  
   Based on the logic gates and connections in the circuit, we carefully map out the inputs.

3. **Calculating Output**:  
   After performing the necessary logical operations, we derive the correct output bits.

4. **Result**:  
   The final output is `0010`, which is the correct value.
