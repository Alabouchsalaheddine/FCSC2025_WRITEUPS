## Challenge Statement

> Alice loves listening to music. Unfortunately, she misconfigured her firewall and accidentally exposed her music collection on the Internet. Alice organizes her personal collection in an unconventional way: instead of sorting by genre, album, or artist, she renames her music files based on her imagination.
> 
> To begin, connect to her music collection and find the hidden flag in the metadata.
> 
> Alice's music collection is accessible at:
> ```
> nc chall.fcsc.fr 2052
> ```

## Solution

First, we connected to the server:

```bash
nc chall.fcsc.fr 2052
```

We discovered that the server was running **MPD** (Music Player Daemon).

To list available commands, we typed:

```text
commands
```

Then, we listed all available files and their metadata with:

```text
listallinfo
```

The server returned multiple music files. Among them, one file (`reboot.opus`) contained metadata with the flag inside the **Artist** field:

```text
file: reboot.opus
