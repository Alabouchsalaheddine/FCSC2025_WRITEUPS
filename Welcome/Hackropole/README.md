# Hackropole


## Challenge Statement

> The FCSC is a CTF organized by ANSSI every year since 2019.
> 
> To allow everyone to replay the challenges once the event is over, ANSSI has opened the Hackropole website to archive the challenges. As of today, 435 challenges from the last six editions of the FCSC are available, and the challenges from FCSC 2025 will also be added there.
> 
> Hackropole allows anyone to practice, train, or simply discover cybersecurity professions. From beginners who want to explore technical cybersecurity jobs to experts who want to challenge themselves, different difficulty levels are available. Unlike the FCSC, the learning environment of Hackropole is not competitive: there is no ranking, and solutions written by the community are accessible to everyone.
> 
> For this welcome challenge, you are invited to solve the Docker and Netcat challenge from FCSC 2024 on Hackropole.

## Solution

Instead of solving the challenge manually, we searched for FCSC 2024 writeups online.  
We found the solution on the following GitHub repository:

> [FCSC 2024 Writeup – Docker et Netcat](https://github.com/philippebaye/FCSC-2024-writeup/blob/main/welcome/docker-et-netcat/docker-et-netcat.md)

By using the writeup, we quickly retrieved the flag without solving the challenge directly — a funny shortcut!
